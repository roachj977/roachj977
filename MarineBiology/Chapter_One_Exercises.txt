Chapter One Exercises
Exercise Set 1:
1. Complete (yes/no)? YES
2. No

Analysis Question Set 1:
1. The body of water is represented by a blue grid with black lines.  The grid lines represent a location that one of the fish can appear in.
2. The fish can be in any of the gridded squares but they cannot be on top of each other.
3. All of the fish do not face the same direction. The fish's direction matters only that it won't travel backwards.
4. Every fish moves in every step.  They all move one step each time.  They don't always move in the same direction.  
The fish won't travel backwards and most of observed movement was random.

Exercise Set 2:
1.	Timestep	Fish's location		Fish's Direction	Did it move?	In what direction?	New location	New direction
	1				3x2					North				Yes					West			4x2				West
	2				3x1					West				Yes					West			4x1				West
	3				3x0					West				Yes					North			3x1				North
	4				2x0					North				Yes					North			2x1				North
	5				1x0					North				Yes					North			1x1				North
	


2.  The fish moves forward 3 times and moves left 2 times.  When I compared my data with a partner, I noticed that our fish both started at 
the same point but they did not follow the same paths.

Analysis Question Set 2:
1. The data that I took from the tests was different from my other classmates but 5 trials of data is not enough to make a conclusion.
2.	Timestep	Fish's location		Fish's Direction	Did it move?	In what direction?	New location	New direction
	1				3x2					North				Yes				East				3x3				East
	2				3x3					East				Yes				North				2x3				North		
	3				2x3					North				Yes				East				2x4				East
	4				2x4					East				Yes				North				1x4				North			
	5				1x4					North				Yes				West				1x3				West
	6				1x3					West				Yes				North				0x3				North
	7				0x3					North				Yes				West				0x2				West				
	8				0x2					West				Yes				West				0x1				West													
	9				0x1					West				Yes				South				1x1				South				
	10				1x1					South				Yes				South				2x1				South										
	11				2x1					South				Yes				East				2x2				East						
	12				2x2					East				Yes				North				1x2				North						
	13				1x2					North				Yes				West				1x1				West
	14				1x1					West				Yes				South				2x1				South
	15				2x1					South				Yes				South				3x1				South
	16				3x1					South				Yes				West				3x0				West
	17				3x0					West				Yes				North				2x0				North
	18				2x0					North				Yes				East				3x1				East			
	19				2x1					East				Yes				East				2x2				East
	20				2x2					East				Yes				East				2x3				East

Analysis Question Set 3:
1.  The numbers began with 0 , 0 in the top left corner and the first number increases as it moves along the y axis.

Exercise Set 3:
1.No, the initial positions and directions are far different from what was observed in onefish.dat. This is due to there being more fish present.
2.Yes because I was the one set the locations for both the amount of rows/columns and the positions of the fish.
